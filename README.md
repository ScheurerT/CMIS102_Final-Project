# CMIS102_Final-Project
Final Project submission to CMIS 102 submitted 11 April 2023

This was my final project that I submitted to my CMIS 102 - Introduction to Algorithms and Problem Solving

The criteria was to create a simple program that would ask the user what home cleaning and yard cleaning services they wanted to order from a fictional company.
Beacuse this is an introduction to programming class, there were not extensive expectations except to demonstrate principals of programming that we learned such as
Functions, While / for loops, etc. We had to prompt the user to ask if they are eligble for a senior citizen discount. 

I decided to expand on the program by creating something with a menu that could be navigated freely and adding a cart function to track all the purchases made. The
downside to this approach is that navigation is done through the terminal. I attempted to learn TKinter in order to provide an easy GUI enabled "Webpage"-esque program
but was unable to learn this library quickly enough to incorporate it.
